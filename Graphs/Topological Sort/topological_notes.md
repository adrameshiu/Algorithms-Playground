# Topological Sort

When one has to be finished before the other

We look for a directed graph which only points forward or in a direction

## Approach

`Depth First Search`

- sink vertex -> no outgoing arcs-> no pre requsities

## Applications

- Classes

- Precedence



## Necessary condition

- `acyclic`

## Time Complexity

- `linear time`
- every edge and every arc is traversed once only
- O(m+n)
